        Parameters
        ----------
        sg : Optional[int] {1, 0}
            Defines the training algorithm. If 1, skip-gram is employed;
            otherwise, CBOW is used. For GeneWalk this is set to 1.
        vector_size : Optional[int]
            Dimensionality of the node vectors. Default for GeneWalk is 8.
        window : Optional[int]
            a.k.a. context size. Maximum distance between the current and
            predicted word within a sentence. For GeneWalk this is set to 1
            to assess directly connected nodes only.
        min_count : Optional[int]
            Ignores all words with total frequency lower than this. For
            GeneWalk this is set to 0.
        negative : Optional[int]
            If > 0, negative sampling will be used, the int for negative
            specifies how many "noise words" should be drawn (usually between
            5-20). If set to 0, no negative sampling is used.
            Default for GeneWalk is 5.
        workers : Optional[int]
            Use these many worker threads to train the model (=faster training
            with multicore machines).
        sample : Optional[float]
            The threshold for configuring which higher-frequency words are
            randomly downsampled, useful range is (0, 1e-5). parameter t in eq
            5 Mikolov et al. For GeneWalk this is set to 0.
